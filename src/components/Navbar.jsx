      <h1>Crypto Tracker</h1>
      <div className="dark-mode__toggle">
        <div

/*## STEP 3 - Using the hook in a component

Now that we have composed our different pieces of stateful logic, let's use it in our component!

- import the dark mode hook into the `NavBar` component
- Looking at this component, we see that we are controlling the toggle with some state. The state hook here returns a `darkMode` value, and a `setDarkMode` function. Isn't that exactly what our `useDarkMode` hook returns as well? Replace the state hook with our hook, click the toggle, and watch the magic happen!!!

(If it wasn't magical, you have a bug somewhere ðŸ˜« go back through the steps slowly, one at a time, to see if you missed any of the steps)
